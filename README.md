# IceSicle
IceSicle is a sliding puzzle game, with 5 blocks in each row and column. A user would be asked to select level [easy, medium, hard] and then the game shall start. The blocks are respresented as ice cubes floating on ocean, and the initial time is set to sunrise. All you need to do it fix the puzzle before the ice melts. You can see the remaining time on the side of screen. You also have 2 special power swaps, that you can use to swap positions of any two blocks across the arrangement. If you complete the puzzle within the time, youll be declared as a winner and your final score would be calculated based on the time you took to complete it. Otherwise, if you fail to complete the puzzle within the time frame, the game would be over.
